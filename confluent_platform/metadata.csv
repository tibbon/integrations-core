kafka.controller.kafka_controller.offline_partitions_count,gauge,,,,Number of partitions that donâ€™t have an active leader and are hence not writable or readable. Alert if value is greater than 0,,,
kafka.controller.kafka_controller.active_controller_count,gauge,,,,Number of active controllers in the cluster. Alert if the aggregated sum across all brokers in the cluster is anything other than 1 because there should be exactly one controller per cluster,,,
